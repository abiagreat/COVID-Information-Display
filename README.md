Prototype 

The application displays COVID-19 information for every country and is accessible to everyone. The user would pick from the drop box which country they would want to know about and COVID information about that country would be displayed. The application is intended for any user who visits the site or wants to know information about COVID-19. The application is intended for anyone who wants to gain information about COVID in any country. 

The main page displays information about the top ten countries with the highest number of COVID cases. The main page is also the search page for the user. From the main page, the user would pick a country from the drop box, and click on “Search” where a pop-up screen would appear and display the COVID information for the specific country chosen. The information regarding that specific country would be displayed. If the user wishes to return to the main page, they would click “back” and they would potentially return to the main page.
